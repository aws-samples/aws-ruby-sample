# Instantiate a new client for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). With no
# parameters or configuration, the AWS SDK for Ruby will look for access keys
# and region in these environment variables:
#
#    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='...'
#    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='...'
#    AWS_REGION='...'
#

# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/S3/Resource.html

# Everything uploaded to Amazon S3 must belong to a bucket. These buckets are
# in the global namespace, and must have a unique name.
#
# For more information about bucket name restrictions, see:
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html

# Files in Amazon S3 are called "objects" and are stored in buckets. A specific
# object is referred to by its key (i.e., name) and holds data. Here, we construct
# a reference to a new object with the key "ruby_sample_key.txt" and then
# "put" the object with the body "Hello World!".
#
# For more information on Aws::S3::Object#put, see:
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/S3/Object.html#put-instance_method

  acl: "public-read",
